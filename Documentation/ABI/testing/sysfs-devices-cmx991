Description:    (RW) Transceiver Power State
        
                Controls the power state of the transceiver.  If 0, the transceiver 
                is off and powered down. This is the initial state of the transceiver
                on power up.  If set to 1 this powers up the transceiver and puts it 
                into "receive" mode with all of the appropriate components set up for
                receive.  This will also power on the IF PLL, so it is advisable to
                make sure the IF PLL M and N values are correct before powering on
                the chip.

Description:    (RW) PLL M Value

                The M divider value for the IF PLL.  This is a 13-bit unsigned value so 
                values can range from 1 to 8191 inclusive.  Valid values can be expressed 
                in hex using the 0x prefix, octal using the 0 prefix or are interpreted 
                as decimal values without any prefix.

Description:    (RW) PLL N Value

                The N divider value for the IF PLL.  This is a 15-bit unsigned value so 
                values can range from 1 to 32767 inclusive.  Valid values can be 
                expressed in hex using the 0x prefix, octal using the 0 prefix or are
                interpreted as decimal values without any prefix.

Description:    (RO) PLL Lock Status

                This shows the status of the IF PLL lock.  If the value is 1, the PLL is 
                locked.  Otherwise the PLL is unlocked.

Description:    (RW) I/Q Variable Gain Amplifier Gain

                The gain of the I/Q Variable Gain Amplifiers.  Values are in dB in steps
                of 6dB over a range from 0dB to -48dB.

Description:    (RW) Mixer Out Routing

                Determines the output pin to which the mixer is connected.  A value of 1
                indicates that the mixer output is on MIXOUT1 and a value of 2 indicates
                the mixer output is on MIXOUT2.

                Determines the input pin to which the IF is connected.  A value of 1 
                indicates that the IF input is from IFIP1 and a value of 2 indicates that
                the IF input is from IFIP2.

Description:    (RW) I/Q Filter Bandwidth

                Sets the bandwidth of the receive I/Q filter.  There are two possible 
                values:  1000 indicates a bandwidth of 1MHz and 100 indicates a bandwidth
                of 100kHz.  This also means the filter bandwidth is returned expressed in
                kHz.
